There are seven Python (Version:2.7.11) source code files and two data files in this project. Some libraries are necessary for this project, such as the 'matplotlib', 'numpy', etc. Besides, you should unzip the 'data.rar' and the 'verify.rar' to the root directory of this project. 

1. The 'TheDistributionOfJournalAndConrference.py' is used to analyse the distribution characteristic of the citation counting of journals and conferences. 

2. The 'DifferenceBetweenJournlsAndConferences.py' is used for analysis the difference between various categories of journals and conferences. It can also analysis the distinguishes between journals and conference which are in the same category.

3. The 'weightOfDifferentYear.py' is used to calculate the citation counting weights of differenct publicatons in different years.

4. The 'verify.py' is used to calculate the weighting citation counting of these journals and conferences. With the weghting citation counting, we can classify the journals and conferences with the scheme we proposed in this paper and compare the result with CCF's recommendation list of AI field.

5. The 'Method1.py', 'Method2.py' and 'Method3.py are three method we used in this paper to deal with the missing data.
